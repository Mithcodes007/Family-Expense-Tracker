**🧾 Introduction**

Managing a family’s finances can get tricky when dealing with multiple incomes and expenses. That’s why I built the Family Expense Tracker — a simple and user-friendly tool that makes it easier to:

💼 Add Family Members
💵 Record Earnings for Each Member
📉 Track Expenses
💰 Calculate Remaining Balance

With this tracker, monitoring your family’s financial situation becomes seamless and organized.

**✨ Features**

Add Family Members → Easily add names of members you want to track.

Record Earnings → Input earnings for each member; the tracker auto-calculates the total.

Track Expenses → Log different expenses (like groceries, bills, etc.), and the app deducts them from total income.

View Balance → Get an instant snapshot of what’s left after expenses.

Clean UI → Built with Streamlit for a smooth, interactive experience.

**🛠️ How to Use**

Add Family Members

Run the app and add family members’ names.

Record Earnings

Enter each member’s earnings; total family income updates automatically.

Track Expenses

The app calculates the remaining balance in real-time.
